The users send the signals using multiband DS-CDMA transmission; the particular complete complementary code sets are used as spreading sets and to provide orthogonality and signal separation. These codes sets have an impulsive autocorrelation sum among ea...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tShow More\n\t\t"
"\n\t\t\tThis paper presents two constructions of Gaussian integer Z-periodic complementary sequence (ZPCS) sets. Construction I employs a ZPCS set as the original sequence set, however, the parameters of the resultant sequence sets cannot be flexibly chosen. Construction II generates Gaussian integer ZPCS sets using an orthogonal matrix, the ZCZ length and the flock size have flexible choices. The s...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tShow More\n\t\t"
"\n\t\t\tThe Doppler sensitivity issue is an urgent problem to be solved for the phase-coded radar although it can give the promise of improved range resolution and resistance against various kinds of distortion. Due to the ideal autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties, the complementary sequence is utilised in high-frequency surface wave radar and MIMO radar. However, the Doppler freq...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tShow More\n\t\t"
"\n\t\t\tCommon signals in public channels of cellular systems are usually transmitted omnidirectionally by the base station (BS) to ensure cell-wide coverage. In this paper, two categories of omnidirectional space-time block codes (STBCs) are proposed to broadcast the common information omnidirectionally in three-dimensional (3D) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. By utilizing Za...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tShow More\n\t\t"
